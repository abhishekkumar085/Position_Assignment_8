        On one lovely evening, a young boy was laughing and playing in the
        garden. He was chasing butterflies as he ran across the beautiful
        flowers. He also saw a bulky cow who was trying to keep a bug away by
        swirling her tail. The boy saw different animals like frogs, fish, etc.
        The child laughed and enjoyed the whole scene a lot. He then saw a small
        brown squirrel running here and there, he tried to follow it and reached
        a flower bed. It had beautiful red roses, the boy tried to pick one
        flower but the thorns plugged his finger. He ran to his mother crying
        and told her about everything. Listening to this his mother explained
        that we must not put any sort of harm to nature instead we should help
        it to grow. The boy learned a new lesson and was very happy.
